Hi, I'm Alexei Ledenev. This is my personal blog where I write about technology that I find interesting, particularly in the fields of cloud computing, DevOps, and software development.

I have extensive experience in designing and implementing cloud-native solutions, with a focus on containerization, microservices architecture, and DevOps practices.

## My Open Source Work

### [Pumba](https://github.com/alexei-led/pumba)

Pumba is a chaos testing tool for containers. It helps you test the resilience of your applications by simulating various failure scenarios.

### [KubeIP v2](https://github.com/doitintl/kubeip)

KubeIP is a tool for managing IP addresses in Kubernetes clusters. It provides a simple way to allocate and static public IP addresses to Kubernetes Nodes on AWS, Google Cloud and Oracle Cloud.

### [K8s-MCP-Server](https://github.com/alexei-led/k8s-mcp-server)

K8s-mcp-server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI assistants like Claude to securely execute Kubernetes commands. It provides a bridge between language models and essential Kubernetes CLI tools including `kubectl`, `helm`, `istioctl`, and `argocd`, allowing AI systems to assist with cluster management, troubleshooting, and deployments.

### [AWS-MCP-Server](https://github.com/alexei-led/aws-mcp-server)

A lightweight service that enables AI assistants to execute AWS CLI commands (in safe containerized environment) through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Bridges Claude, Cursor, and other MCP-aware AI tools with AWS CLI for enhanced cloud infrastructure management.

### [Spotinfo](https://github.com/alexei-led/spotinfo)

CLI for exploring AWS EC2 Spot inventory. Inspect AWS Spot instance types, saving, price, and interruption frequency.

### [Secrets-Init](https://github.com/doitintl/secrets-init)

A minimalistic init system for containers with AWS/GCP secrets support. It provides a simple way to automatically inject secrets into your containers at runtime.

### [Kube-Secrets-Init](https://github.com/doitintl/kube-secrets-init)

The kube-secrets-init is a Kubernetes mutating admission webhook, that mutates any K8s Pod (injects `secrets-init` init system) that is using specially prefixed environment variables, directly or from Kubernetes as Secret or ConfigMap. It simplifies the management of secrets in Kubernetes environments by automating the injection process.
