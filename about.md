Hi, I'm Alexei Lednev. This is my personal blog where I write about technology, Kubernetes, Docker, and cloud infrastructure.

I have extensive experience in designing and implementing cloud-native solutions, with a focus on containerization, microservices architecture, and DevOps practices.

Feel free to connect with me on [GitHub](https://github.com/alexei-led).
