## 2024
- **[KubeIP v2: Assigning Static Public IPs to Kubernetes Nodes Across Cloud Providers](/kubeip_v2.md)** (2024-04-04)
  *Tags: AWS, Google Cloud, Static IP, Kubernetes, KubeIP, Public IP, NAT Gateway, IPv4, IPv6*
  Kubernetes nodes can benefit from having dedicated static public IP addresses in certain scenarios.

## 2021

  *Tags: AWS, EC2, Spot, tool*
  The `spotinfo` is a command-line tool you can use for exploring AWS Spot instances.

## 2020

  It is not a rare case when an application running on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) needs to access Amazon Web Services (AWS) APIs.

- **[Building Multi-Platform Docker Images for Intel and ARM with AWS CodeBuild](/docker_multi_arch_aws.md)** (2020-09-30)
  *Tags: Docker, AWS, CodeBuild, DevOps, CI/CD, ARM, Multi-Arch*
  The Docker BuildKit buildx CLI plugin simplifies building Docker images for different OS/CPU platforms.

## 2019
- **[Kubernetes and Secrets Management in Cloud](/secrets-init.md)** (2019-12-23)
  *Tags: Kubernetes, EKS, GKE, AWS, GCP, Secrets Manager*
  Secrets are essential for operation of many production systems. Unintended secrets exposure is one of the top risks that should be properly addressed.

- **[EKS GPU Cluster from Zero to Hero](/eks_gpu_spot.md)** (2019-07-20)
  *Tags: Kubernetes, EKS, GPU, Spot, AWS, Machine Learning*
  If you ever tried to run a GPU workload on Kubernetes cluster, you know that this task requires non-trivial configuration and comes with high cost tag (GPU instances are quite expensive).

- **[Get a Shell to a Kubernetes Node](/k8s_node_shell.md)** (2019-07-27)
  *Tags: Kubernetes, DevOps, root, AWS, SSH*
  Throughout the lifecycle of your Kubernetes cluster, you may need to access a cluster worker node.

- **[Kubernetes Continuous Integration](/kubernetes_continuous_integration.md)** (2019-03-08)
  *Tags: Kubernetes, CI/CD, Continuous Integration, Helm*
  Complex Kubernetes application consists from multiple Kubernetes resources, defined in YAML files.

## 2017
- **[Chaos Testing for Docker Containers](/pumba_containercamp.md)** (2017-10-04)
  *Tags: docker, chaos monkey, chaos testing, chaos, testing, devops, chaos engineering, netem, network emulation*
  What follows is the text of my presentation, *Chaos Testing for Docker Containers* that I gave at ContainerCamp in London this year.

- **[Debugging remote Node.js application running in a Docker container](/debug_node_in_docker.md)** (2017-06-03)
  *Tags: docker, tutorial, devops, hacks, node, node.js, debug, Dockerfile*
  Suppose you want to debug a Node.js application already running on a remote machine inside Docker container.

- **[Create lean Node.js image with Docker multi-stage build](/node_docker_multistage.md)** (2017-04-25)
  *Tags: docker, tutorial, devops, hacks, node, node.js, multistage, Dockerfile*
  Starting from Docker 17.05+, you can create a single `Dockerfile` that can build multiple helper images with compilers, tools, and tests and use files from above images to produce the **final** Docker image.

- **[Crafting perfect Java Docker build flow](/perfect_docker_java.md)** (2017-03-07)
  *Tags: docker, tutorial, devops, hacks, java, maven*
  What is the bare minimum you need to **build**, **test** and **run** my Java application in Docker container?

## 2016
- **[Everyday hacks for Docker](/everyday_hacks.md)** (2017-01-02)
  *Tags: docker, tutorial, devops, hacks*
  In this post, I've decided to share with you some useful commands and tools, I'm frequently using, working with amazing Docker technology.

- **[Deploy Docker Compose (v3) to Swarm (mode) Cluster](/composev3_swarm.md)** (2016-12-18)
  *Tags: docker, swarm, docker-compose, compose, devops, cluster*
  Docker 1.13 simplifies deployment of composed application to a swarm (mode) cluster.

- **[Do not ignore .dockerignore](/donot_ignore_dockerignore.md)** (2016-11-26)
  *Tags: Docker, build, dockerignore, devops*
  Consider to define and use `.dockerignore` file for every Docker image you are building. It can help you to reduce Docker image size, speedup `docker build` and avoid unintended secret exposure.

- **[Docker Swarm cluster with docker-in-docker on MacOS](/swarm_dind.md)** (2016-10-06)
  *Tags: Docker, Swarm, MasOS, 1.12*
  Docker-in-Docker [dind] can help you to run Docker Swarm cluster on your Macbook only with Docker for Mac (v1.12+). No `virtualbox`, `docker-machine`, `vagrant` or other app is required.

- **[Network emulation for Docker containers](/pumba_docker_netem.md)** (2016-08-01)
  *Tags: Docker, testing, chaos testing, netem, network*
  Pumba `netem delay` and `netem loss` commands can emulate network *delay* and *packet loss* between Docker containers, even on single host. Give it a try!

- **[Pumba - Chaos Testing for Docker](/pumba_docker_chaos_testing.md)** (2016-04-16)
  *Tags: Docker, testing, chaos testing, resilience*
  The best defense against unexpected failures is to build resilient services. Testing for resiliency enables the teams to learn where their apps fail before the customer does.

- **[Testing Strategies for Docker Containers](/docker_testing.md)** (2016-03-07)
  *Tags: Docker, testing, integration test, Dockerfile*
  Congratulations! You know how to build a Docker image and are able to compose multiple containers into a meaningful application.

- **[Docker Pattern: The Build Container](/docker_builder_pattern.md)** (2016-01-14)
  *Tags: Docker, pattern, Dockerfile*
  Let's say that you're developing a microservice in a compiled language or an interpreted language that requires some additional "build" steps to package and lint your application code.

## 2015
- **[Docker Pattern: Deploy and update dockerized application on cluster](/docker_cd_cluster.md)** (2015-12-30)
  *Tags: Docker, CoreOS, fleet*
  Docker is great technology that simplifies development and deployment of distributed applications.
