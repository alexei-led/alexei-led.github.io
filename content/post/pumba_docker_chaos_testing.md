## Introduction

The best defense against unexpected failures is to build resilient services. Testing for resiliency enables the teams to learn where their apps fail before the customer does. By intentionally causing failures as part of resiliency testing, you can enforce your policy for building resilient systems.
Resilience of the system can be defined as its ability to continue functioning even if some components of the system are failing - ![ephemeraliaty](/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemerality). Growing popularity of distributed and microservice architecture makes resilience testing critical for applications that now require 24x7x365 operation. 
Resilience Testing is an approach where you intentionally inject different types of failures at the infrastructure level (VM, network, containers and  processes) and let your system try to recover from these unexpected failures that can happen in the real world. Simulating realistic failures at any time is the best way to enforce highly available and resilient systems.

## What is Pumba?

![Pumba](/img/pumba_docker.png)

First of all, [Pumba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timon_and_Pumbaa) (or Pumbaa) is a supporting character from Disney's animated film *The Lion King*. In Swahili, *pumbaa* means "to be foolish, silly, weakminded, careless, negligent". And this actually reflects the desired behaviour of application. 

Pumba is inspired by the highly popular [Netfix Chaos Monkey](https://github.com/Netflix/SimianArmy/wiki/Chaos-Monkey) resilience testing tool for AWS. Pumba takes a similar approach, but applies it at a container level. It connects to the Docker daemon running on some machine (local or remote) and brings levels of chaos to it: randomly killing, stopping, and removing running containers.

If the system is designed to be resilient, it should be able to recover from such failures. "Failed" services should be restarted,  lost connections should be recovered, application should degrade gracefully. Example, when you go into a tunnel and the network connection is lost, google maps does not crash, the app says "try again" and will automatically try to re-connect. This is not as trivial as it sounds. Designing services differently requires the team to be aware that any service can fail for any reason including the service it depends on as well as the resources can dissappear at any point in time and re-appear. Expect the unexpected!

## Why to run Pumba?

Failures happen and they will happen at the most inopportune time. If the application cannot recover from system failures, you are going to face angry customers and maybe even loose them. To be sure that your system is able to recover from unexpected failures, it would be best to test for them by intentionally injecting failures instead of dealing with very bad consequences for your organization. They will happen -- likely in production. This is not a one time effort. In the age of Continious Delivery, we need to be sure that every change to any one of system services does not compromise system avaiability and resilience. That's why we should practice **continuous resilience testing**.
With Docker gaining popularity, running clusters of container using some kind of container orchestration network (Kubernetes, Swarm, CoreOS fleet), it's possible to restart "failed" containers automatically. How can we be sure that restarted services and other system services can recover from various system failures? Also if you are not using a container orchestration framework, it is even harder: we need to handle container restarts manually.

With Pumba on every Docker host and in your cluster, it can occassionally be triggered to "randomly" stop running containers, matching specified name/s or name patterns. You can specify the *signal*, that will be sent to "kill" the container.

## How to run Pumba?

There are two ways to run Pumba.

First, you can download Pumba application (single binary file) for your OS from project [release page](https://github.com/gaia-adm/pumba/releases) and run `pumba help` and `pumba run --help` to see list of supported options.

```
$ pumba help

NAME:
   Pumba - Pumba is a resiliency tool that helps applications tolerate random Docker container failures.

USAGE:
   pumba [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]

VERSION:
   0.1.4

COMMANDS:
    run	Pumba starts making chaos: periodically (and randomly) kills/stops/remove specified containers

GLOBAL OPTIONS:
   --host, -H "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"  daemon socket to connect to [$DOCKER_HOST]
   --tls                                     use TLS; implied by --tlsverify
   --tlsverify                               use TLS and verify the remote [$DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY]
   --tlscacert "/etc/ssl/docker/ca.pem"      trust certs signed only by this CA
   --tlscert "/etc/ssl/docker/cert.pem"      client certificate for TLS authentication
   --tlskey "/etc/ssl/docker/key.pem"        client key for TLS authentication
   --debug                                   enable debug mode with verbose logging
   --help, -h                                show help
   --version, -v                             print the version
```

```
$ pumba run --help

NAME:
   pumba run - Pumba starts making chaos: periodically (and randomly) kills/stops/remove specified containers

USAGE:
   pumba run [command options] [arguments...]

OPTIONS:
   --chaos, -c [--chaos option --chaos option]    chaos command: `container(s,)/re2:regex|interval(s/m/h postfix)|STOP/KILL(:SIGNAL)/RM`
   --random, -r                                   Random mode: randomly select single matching container to 'kill'
```

The `run` command is pretty simple. If you already have Docker client installed and configured on your machine (i.e. `$DOCKER_HOST` environment variable is defined), execute `run` with `--chaos` options (and optionally `--random`). And that's all.

### The "run" command

The `run` command follows by one or more `--chaos` options, each of them is a 3-tuple (or triple), separated by `|` (vertical bar) character, that specifies container(s), recurrence interval and the "kill" command to run.

#### `--chaos, -c` option(s): 3-tuple structure

1. First argument can be:
  - *name* - container name
  - *names* - comma separated list of container names
  - *empty* - empty string; means ALL containers
  - *re2:regex* - [RE2](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) regular expression; all matching containers will be "killed". Use `re2:` prefix to specify regular expression.
2. Recurrence interval - `pumba` will run specified command recurrently, based on interval definition
  - An interval is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "-1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
3. "Kill" command
  - `STOP` - stop running container(s)
  - `KILL(:SIGNAL)` - kill running container, with specified (optional) **signal**: `SIGTERM`, `SIGKILL`, `SIGSTOP` and others. `SIGKILL` is the default signal, that will be sent if no signal is specified.
  - `RM` - force remove running container(s)

#### `--random, -r` option

Use this option to randomly select **single** matching container, specified by `--chaos` option.

#### Examples

```
# stop random container once in a 10 minutes
$ ./pumba run --chaos "|10m|STOP" --random
```

```
# every 15 minutes kill `mysql` container and every hour remove containers starting with "hp"
$ ./pumba run -c "mysql|15m|KILL:SIGTERM" -c "re2:^hp|1h|RM"
```

```
# every 30 seconds kill "worker1" and "worker2" containers and every 3 minutes stop "queue" container
$ ./pumba run --chaos "worker1,worker2|30s|KILL:SIGKILL" --chaos "queue|3m|STOP"
```

### Running Pumba in Docker Container

The second approach is to run it in a Docker container.
In order to give Pumba access to Docker daemon on host machine, you will need to mount `var/run/docker.sock` unix socket.

```
# run latest stable Pumba docker image (from master repository)
$ docker run -d -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock gaiaadm/pumba:master run --chaos "|10m|STOP" --random
```

Pumba will not kill its own containe no matter what. You cannot run multiple Pumba containers on same host. If you try to run more than one, only last one will run and will stop all previous Pumba containers.
